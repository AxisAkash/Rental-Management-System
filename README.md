# Rental-Management-System
The Rental Management System is a .NET desktop app that simplifies property rentals by letting tenants view and book available flats or roomsâ€”either full family flats or individual rooms. Owners can be Normal or Premium, with premium posts shown first. An Admin Panel ensures transparent, efficient management of users and properties.
